# IrisClassification

Iris classification is a common problem in machine learning
In this, we classify the iris flower into three species namely setosa, versicolor and vergenica.
We have classified on the basis of four properties:
1. Sepal Length
2. Sepal Width
3. Petal Length
4. Petal Width

We develop a model in which the properties are the inputs and the species is the output.
We use data science techniques and algorithms to train the model.
Some of the common techniques include:
1. Logistic Regression: A linear model used for binary classification tasks but can be extended to multiclass classification as well.
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric method that classifies samples based on the majority class among their k nearest neighbors.
3. Decision Trees: A tree-like model where decisions are made based on feature values at different nodes.
